<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>By creating an account or using the Vocè mobile application (the "App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>
<hr />
<h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
<p>Vocè is a communication advisor powered by artificial intelligence. The App analyzes conversations you share and provides strategic advice, response options, and relationship insights to help you communicate more effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Vocè is powered by artificial intelligence. You are interacting with AI, not a human.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
<p>You must be at least <strong>18 years of age</strong> to create an account and use Vocè. By creating an account, you represent and warrant that you are 18 years of age or older. Vocè may not be suitable for minors.</p>
<p>We verify age at signup through a date-of-birth confirmation. If we learn that a user is under 18, we will terminate their account and delete their data.</p>
<hr />
<h2>4. What Vocè Is NOT</h2>
<p><strong>Vocè is not a substitute for professional services.</strong> Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vocè is <strong>not</strong> a licensed counseling, therapy, or mental health service.</li>
<li>Vocè is <strong>not</strong> a healthcare provider or medical device.</li>
<li>Vocè is <strong>not</strong> a legal advisor or law firm.</li>
<li>Vocè is <strong>not</strong> an emergency service.</li>
<li>Vocè does <strong>not</strong> employ licensed therapists, counselors, or healthcare professionals to review your conversations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The advice provided by Vocè is generated by AI and is intended for informational and educational purposes only. You should not rely on Vocè's advice as a substitute for professional counseling, therapy, legal advice, or emergency services.</p>
<p><strong>If you are experiencing a mental health crisis, are in danger, or are considering self-harm or suicide, please contact emergency services (911) or a crisis helpline immediately:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline:</strong> Call or text 988</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<h2>5. Account and Security</h2>
<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if we believe you have violated these Terms.</p>
<hr />
<h2>6. User Content</h2>
<p>"User Content" means any text, images, screenshots, or other content you submit through the App. You retain ownership of your User Content. By submitting User Content, you grant Vocè a limited, non-exclusive license to process, store, and analyze your content solely for the purpose of providing the service to you.</p>
<p>You represent and warrant that you have the right to submit any content you provide. You are responsible for any content you submit, including any screenshots of conversations with other people.</p>
<p>We do not use your User Content for advertising, marketing to third parties, or to train AI models. See our Privacy Policy for details on how your data is handled.</p>
<hr />
<h2>7. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
<p>Vocè offers a free tier with limited features and a paid subscription ("Vocè Pro") with additional features. Subscription pricing, features, and trial terms are displayed in the App at the time of purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Free Trial:</strong> New users may receive a free trial of Vocè Pro. Trial terms are displayed during signup. After the trial period ends, your account reverts to the free tier unless you subscribe.</p>
<p><strong>Billing:</strong> Subscriptions are billed through Apple's in-app purchase system. Subscription management, cancellation, and refund requests are handled through your Apple ID account settings. Vocè does not directly process payments or store payment information.</p>
<p><strong>Cancellation:</strong> You may cancel your subscription at any time through your Apple ID settings. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period. No refunds are provided for partial billing periods.</p>
<p><strong>Price Changes:</strong> We may change subscription pricing with reasonable advance notice. Price changes will not affect your current billing period.</p>
<hr />
<h2>8. Acceptable Use</h2>

</ul>
<hr />
<h2>9. AI-Generated Content</h2>
<p>The advice, analysis, and response options provided by Vocè are generated by artificial intelligence. AI-generated content may sometimes be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate. You should always exercise your own judgment before acting on Vocè's suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>Vocè presents communication options — you always make the final decision.</strong> Vocè never sends messages on your behalf. You are solely responsible for any messages you choose to send based on Vocè's suggestions.</p>
<hr />
<h2>10. Safety Features</h2>
<p>Vocè includes automated safety features designed to detect conversations involving potential crisis situations such as domestic violence, self-harm, or abuse. When these features are triggered, Vocè provides crisis resource information.</p>
<p>These safety features are automated and AI-powered. They are not a substitute for professional crisis intervention. They may not detect all crisis situations, and they may occasionally produce false positives. See our Safety Protocol (voce-app.com/safety) for details.</p>
<hr />
