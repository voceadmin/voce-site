<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Vocè — Communication Advisor</strong>
<strong>Last Updated: February 26, 2026</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Vocè ("we," "us," or "our") is a communication advisor app powered by artificial intelligence. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use the Vocè mobile application (the "App").</p>
<div class="callout"><p><strong>Important:</strong> Vocè is powered by artificial intelligence. You are interacting with AI, not a human. Vocè is not a licensed counseling service, healthcare provider, or substitute for professional advice.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<h3>Information You Provide</h3>
<p><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your email address, name, and date of birth. We use date of birth solely to verify that you are 18 years of age or older, as required by our Terms of Service.</p>
<p><strong>Conversation Content:</strong> When you use Vocè, you may provide text descriptions of conversations and upload screenshots of text conversations. This content is processed by our AI system to generate communication advice. We store this content in your account to provide relationship memory and personalized advice across sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Information:</strong> You may create contact profiles (names and relationship types) for the people you communicate about. This information is stored in your account to provide contextual advice.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome Data:</strong> When you report how a conversation went (positive, mixed, or negative), we store this feedback to improve future advice for that relationship.</p>
<h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
<p><strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect device type, operating system version, and app version for troubleshooting and compatibility purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect anonymized usage metrics such as feature usage frequency, session duration, and navigation patterns. We use this data to improve the App.</p>
<p><strong>Push Notification Tokens:</strong> If you enable push notifications, we store your device's push token to send follow-up reminders.</p>
<h3>Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
<p>We do not collect precise location data. We do not access your contacts, call logs, or any data outside of what you explicitly provide within the App.</p>
<hr />
<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>We use your information for the following purposes:</p>
<p><strong>To provide the service:</strong> Processing your conversation content through our AI system to generate communication advice, response options, and relationship insights.</p>
<p><strong>To personalize your experience:</strong> Storing relationship history and communication patterns to provide increasingly relevant advice over time ("Relationship Memory").</p>
<p><strong>To operate and improve the App:</strong> Analyzing anonymized, aggregated usage patterns to improve features, fix bugs, and develop new capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>To communicate with you:</strong> Sending push notifications for follow-up prompts ("How did it go?"), service announcements, and account-related communications.</p>
<p><strong>To process payments:</strong> Managing your subscription status through our payment processor (RevenueCat). We do not directly store your payment card information.</p>
<hr />
<h2>AI Processing</h2>
<p>Vocè uses the Claude API (provided by Anthropic) to process your conversation content and generate advice. When you submit a conversation for analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your message text, any uploaded screenshots, and relevant relationship context are sent to Anthropic's API for processing.</li>
<li>Anthropic processes this data according to their API terms, which prohibit using customer data to train their models.</li>
<li>The AI-generated response is returned to the App and stored in your account.</li>
<li>Screenshots are stored in encrypted cloud storage (Supabase) and are accessible only to your account.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not use your conversation content, screenshots, or personal information for advertising, marketing to third parties, or AI model training.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
<p>Your data is stored on Supabase, a cloud database platform with encryption at rest and in transit. All data transmission between the App and our servers uses TLS encryption.</p>
<p>We implement Row Level Security (RLS) to ensure that your data is accessible only by your authenticated account. No other user can access your conversations, contacts, or analysis results.</p>
<p>While we take reasonable measures to protect your information, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
<p><strong>Auto-Delete:</strong> You may configure automatic deletion of conversations older than 90 days, 6 months, 1 year, or never (default: 6 months). This setting is available in the App under Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Data.</p>
<p><strong>Manual Deletion:</strong> You may delete individual conversations, contacts, or your entire account at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> When you delete your account, we permanently delete all of your data from our servers, including your profile, contacts, threads, messages, screenshots, and analysis history. This process is irreversible.</p>
<p><strong>Retention after deletion:</strong> Following account deletion, your data is purged from our active database immediately. Backup copies may persist for up to 30 days before being automatically purged.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
<table>

<p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with advertisers or data brokers. We do not display ads in the App.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Law Enforcement and Legal Requests</h2>
<p>We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or if we receive a valid legal request (such as a subpoena, court order, or search warrant). If permitted by law, we will attempt to notify you before disclosing your information in response to a legal request.</p>
<p><strong>Important for users discussing sensitive situations:</strong> Vocè stores conversations that may reference domestic violence, harassment, custody disputes, or other sensitive topics. This data could potentially be subject to subpoena in legal proceedings. If this is a concern, we encourage you to use the auto-delete feature to minimize stored data.</p>
<p>We do not proactively monitor, review, or report the contents of your conversations. Our AI safety features are automated and do not involve human review of your data.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Vocè is designed for users aged 18 and older. We do not knowingly collect information from anyone under 18 years of age. Our sign-up process includes an age verification step that prevents users under 18 from creating an account.</p>
<p>Vocè may not be suitable for minors. If we learn that we have collected information from a user under 18, we will delete that information and terminate the account promptly.</p>
<p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has created a Vocè account, please contact us at support@voce-app.com and we will delete the account.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the following rights:</p>
<p><strong>Access:</strong> You may request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</p>
<p><strong>Deletion:</strong> You may request that we delete your personal data. You can also delete your account directly within the App (Settings &gt; Delete Account).</p>
<p><strong>Export:</strong> You may export your data at any time through the App (Settings &gt; Export Data), which provides your conversation history in a machine-readable format.</p>
<p><strong>Correction:</strong> You may update your account information at any time within the App.</p>
<p><strong>Opt-out of communications:</strong> You may disable push notifications at any time through your device settings or through the App (Settings &gt; Notifications).</p>
<p>To exercise any of these rights, contact us at support@voce-app.com or use the relevant feature within the App.</p>
<h3>California Residents</h3>
<p>If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), including the right to know what personal information we collect, the right to delete your information, and the right to opt out of the sale of your information. We do not sell your personal information.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated policy in the App and updating the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
<hr />
